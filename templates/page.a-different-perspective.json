But while our designs are a huge part of who we are, ‘the why’ and ‘the how’ almost matter more than ‘the what’. It’s easy to tell you what we do, it’s harder to explain why.

At Neptune, we fundamentally believe that things can always be better. That’s our starting point. In everything that we do, from how we design a table to how we approach our delivery service, if there’s a way to improve things for you, rest assured we’ll do it.
