But while our designs are a huge part of who we are, ‘the why’ and ‘the how’ almost matter more than ‘the what’. It’s easy to tell you what we do, it’s harder to explain why. That’s where our philosophy, a different perspective, comes in. Three words that sum up our entire reason for being.<\/p><p><\/p><p>We’re optimists. Relentless ones. At Neptune, we fundamentally believe that things can always be better. That’s our starting point. In everything that we do, from how we design a table to how we approach our delivery service, if there’s a way to improve things for you, rest assured we’ll do it. We’ll never be different for the sake of saying so. But we’ll always go against the grain if it’s going to make your life better.<\/p><p><\/p>",
